I'm currently based in Scotland and since 2017 I've worked as a contractor in knowledge and information management.

During this time I've been lucky enough to work for some big organisations and companies:

- a major international [IT consultancy company](https://www.cgi.com/en)
- a Big Four [accounting firm](https://www.deloitte.com/uk/en/about.html)
- a major [global investment firm](https://www.kkr.com/)
- the UK Government's [Department of Health and Social Care](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-health-and-social-care) and [Department for Science, Innovation and Technology](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-science-innovation-and-technology)
- and a [science NGO](https://council.science/) based in Paris.

Some of these roles have been via my company - Word2Web Ltd (Company number 13390874) - which is still open for business. 😄

Before becoming a contractor (the best career decision of my life so far) I worked in corporate communications for a large UK charity and the NHS. Before that I worked as a website content editor in the days when updating websites for a living was a novelty...And before that (sshhhhh!) I was a librarian. 🤫 📚

So there have been a few career changes so far and given the pace of change these days there may be more to come. I'm [still learning](/learning-odyssey/) as I go.

**One big area of interest to me in this age of AI is what work is left for humans like me to do.** I will be exploring this question from time to time (and hopefully 🙏 coming up with some answers) in my [blog](/blog/) so if this sort of thing interests you too, please stay around.
