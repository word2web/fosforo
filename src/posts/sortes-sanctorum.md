The Sortes Sanctorum was a wee experiment with ChatGPT (the free version) to see if I could use it to build a (very) simple app with little or no coding input from me.

The inspiration for the app was a Medieval fortune telling system with dice called the [Sortes Sanctorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortes_Sanctorum).

I used Google Translate to translate the old texts from Latin and French, and then got ChatGPT to create the code for the virtual dice roll. Bing image creator provided the illustration.
