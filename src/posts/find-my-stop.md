A friend told me about [Cursor](https://cursor.com/en), which bills itself as "the AI code editor" so I thought I'd give it a go. It's a few years since I built the [Sortes Sanctorum](/sortes-sanctorum) with the help of an early version of ChatGPT so I was interested to see how things have progressed since then.

A friend suggested an app that locates your nearest pub - unfortunately there didn't seem to be a free API with that information to draw on (business opportunity? ;-). So, instead here's [Find My Stop](https://find-my-stop.vercel.app) - which uses the UK TransportAPI to list the nearest bus stops or train stations to whatever postcode the user types in.

Even with GPT-4 doing all of the heavy lifting with the code, it still took me about 3-4 hours in total to get it to this state. I'm sure with a bit more experience and some prior research (like locating the APIs I'm planning to use first!) I can get this time down.

Anyway, an interesting and enjoyable first experience 'vibe coding' with Cursor.
