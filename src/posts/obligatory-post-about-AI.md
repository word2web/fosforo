I've admitted that there is still much I don't know about AI. But here are some things I think I know about AI and its impact so far:

<!--more-->

1.  **A lot of the 'magic' in AI comes from maths**. Which is a bit unfortunate for someone who only got a B for Higher Maths. The more I learn about AI, the more I understand just how much it is made possible by mathematics and statistical techniques that are outside my intellectual grasp. On the plus side, computer scientists themselves admit that AI is a “black box” and [<ins>they don’t know how it works</ins>](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/05/1089449/nobody-knows-how-ai-works/). That makes me feel a bit better.
    
2.  **The moment for AI has come**.Clever maths has existed for a long time. When I was at school I was interested in Alan Turing (not enough to get an A in maths though) and his famous "imitation game" test for artificial intelligence. For a long time it was all aspirational but the arrival of large language models like ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude and DeepSearch has changed the game. The imitation game has been won. Why now? It's not just the maths: it's also 20 plus years of the internet and all its data, the advances in computer chips, data storage and always-on cloud computing. This is the digital 'primal soup' from which large language models have emerged. Clever.
    
3.  **We're not ready for the pace of change**. Since 2020, we've all been on a societal and technological rollercoaster. People in a lot of organisations are still getting their heads around using Microsoft Teams and working out the difference between SharePoint and OneDrive never mind what a large language model is. There is a significant educational, economic, environmental ethical and regulatory lag between the new technologies and the human societies they are being “rolled out” to. Individuals, businesses, governments and whole societies are going to be playing catch up for some time.
    
4.  **AI relies on humungous amounts of computer processing power, data storage and electricity** to keep running. In other words, lots of money. And natural resources, including water. There are also 8 billion humans (and counting) people on the planet too. I think it's only a matter of time before there is competition for some if not all of these resources.

5.  **I don't own the means of production. You probably don't either**.The kind of resources needed to keep the lights for AI favour the big players - Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft etc. Small companies, small countries - are going to struggle to compete. And individuals don't stand a chance. The more you use and come to rely on AI, the more you are outsourcing your productivity to a tool you do not own and which can be taken away from you at any time.
    
6.  **AI is better than me. It's probably better than you too.** Yes, there is hype. Yes, AI can't do everything. But if you are a white collar worker like me then there's a good chance AI is already better than you at writing, problem solving, idea generation, summarising, reporting, programming, calculating... and finishing sentences more fluently than this one. Maybe you disagree with me. That's fine. I hope you're right. But the more I interact with large language models like ChatGPT, Grok and DeepSeek, the more I marvel at their capability and don't see how humans can compete if trying to carry out the same task.

7.  **Some jobs (maybe mine) are going to be replaced or downgraded. For the reasons given above.** Provided that AI hangs around for another 5-10 years and humanity does not face some calamity like loss of the electrical grid or losing the ability to make computer chips, then I don't see how some jobs can survive. I just don't.

8.  **AI is a bit scary**. And impressive. Scarily impressive. If you're not a wee bit scared by AI, you're not paying full attention. Or maybe you are one of those humans who still live their lives largely in the analogue world. I'm old enough to remember the analogue world but I was an early and enthusiastic adopter of digital. The internet? It's been great. I've even made a living from it. I can't imagine the last 25 or so years without it. But we're no longer alone on the internet. In fact, it's been some time since the internet was an exclusively human zone. We're rubbing shoulders with chatbots, and multilingual large language models, algorithms and avatars and we are becoming guests in their land. They are the real digital natives. I'm not saying we all go off and retrain as plumbers or gardeners but I do think that some of the answer to the challenges (as well as the opportunities) that AI will bring into our lives is by rediscovering and maybe even reinventing the analogue world.  It is, after all, where humans have spent the first million or so years. What work is still here for us to do?
