## Completed Courses

I love a [MOOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course). Below is a list of the courses I've completed, ordered with the most recent at the top. Where available, I've linked to certificates of completion. Who doesn't love a PDF certificate with their name on it? I know I do ðŸ˜‰
