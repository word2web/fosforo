It wouldn't be 2025 without some talk about AI, so here's mine.

<!--more-->

The first thing I'd say about AI is that there are many things, the most important things actually, I do not know.

I don't really know how AI works 'under the hood'.

I don't know what the implications of AI are for the sort of jobs I do (and whether they will even exist) and for the job market and the economy in general.

I don't know the potential dangers of using AI - for issues like privacy and freedom, intellectual property, information security in the short term and for human and environmental security and wellbeing in the long term.

I also don't how much further AI will develop. Is it close to a developmental plateau or is something more powerful waiting in the wings?

And at the risk of being a wee bit sci-fi and "woo", I don't know the nature of consciousness is (spoiler alert: nobody does). Therefore I can't be fully certain that some of the AI systems I interact with either already possess some kind of consciousness or will do so at some point in the future.

So far, so agnostic.

But there are some things I think it is possible to know about AI, and I will explore them in the next posts.
