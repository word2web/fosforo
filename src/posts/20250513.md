It wouldn't be 2025 without some talk about AI, so here's mine.

<!--more-->

The first thing I'd say about AI is that there are many things, the most important things actually, I do not know. 

I don't really know how AI works 'under the hood'. (There's a lot of maths involved and I only got a B for my Higher Maths).

I don't know what the implications of AI are for the sort of jobs I do (and whether they will even exist) and for the job market and the economy in general.

I don't know the potential dangers of using AI - for issues privacy and freedom, intellectual property, information security and for human and environmental security and wellbeing.

I also don't how much further AI will develop. Is it close to a developmental plateau or is something more powerful waiting in the wings?

And at the risk of being a wee bit sci-fi and "woo", I don't know the nature of consciousness is (spoiler alert: nobody does). Therefore I can't be fully certain that some of the AI systems I interact with either already possess some kind of consciusness or will do so at some point in the future. 

So far, so agnostic.

But there are some things I think I do know about humanity's AI joourney so far so stand by for my earth-shattering insights ;-)

1) **You're probably not going to understand how AI works.**
2) **The moment for AI has come**
3) **The pace of change is speeding up**. Since 2020, we've all been on a societal and technological rollercoaster. Even if ChatGPT and its competitors had not been release in 2022, the sudden and unprecedented shift to remote working and cloud-based platforms such as Microsoft 365 would have been significant enough. *People in a lot of organisations are still getting their heads around using Teams and working out the difference between Sharepoint and OneDrive never mind what a large language model is.*
4) As a result **there is a significant ethical and governental lag** (ISO mention)
5) **A lot of money is at stake** in AI.
6) **You definitely don't own the means of production.** Unless your name is Sam Altmann or Elon Musk (hi guys, don't forget to check out my LinkedIn) then the more you use and come to rely on AI, the more you are 
7) Which brings me to, **AI relies on humungous amounts of computer hardware, processing power and electricity**
8) **AI needs data like we need food**
9) **Large language models are pretty damn impressive**
10) **Yes, some jobs are going to be replaced or downgraded**
11) **Yes, it's all a bit scary.**
12) **For our own good, humans need to rediscover analogue space**
