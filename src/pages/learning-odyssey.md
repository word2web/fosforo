Welcome to my *Learning Odyssey*, where I map my ongoing quest for knowledge and for learning new things.

This page logs the online courses I've most recently completed, along with my profiles on platforms like Microsoft Learning and Salesforce Trailhead.

It also acts as an *aide memoire* for some of my bigger learning goals: subjects I'd like to know more about and languages I'd like to be able to do more than order a coffee in.

## Completed Courses
