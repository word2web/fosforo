I'm based in Scotland and since 2017 I've mainly worked as a contractor in a number of roles ranging from corporate communications to knowledge management consultancy.

During this time I've been lucky enough to work for some big organisations and companies, including the world's 5 largest IT consultancy company, the world's 4 largest private equity company, the UK Government and an international NGO based in Paris.

Some of these roles have been via my company Word2Web Ltd (Company number 13390874). which is still open for business, so if there's anything you think I can help you with, give me a shout.

Before becoming a contractor (the best career decision of my life so far) I worked in corporate communications for a large UK charity and the NHS. Before that I worked as a website content editor (old skool) and before that (sshhhhh!) I was a librarian.

Life's a journey. I'm still on the road and I'm still learning. [Here is a list](/my-learning-odyssey/ "Link to a list of subjects I'm studying") of some of the subjects I'm currently trying to wrap my head around.
