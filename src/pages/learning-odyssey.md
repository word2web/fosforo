This page logs the online courses I've most recently completed, along with my profiles on platforms like Microsoft Learning and Salesforce Trailhead.

It also acts as an *aide memoire* for some of my bigger learning goals: [subjects](#subjects) I'd like to know more about and [languages](#languages) I'd like to be able to do more than order a coffee in.

## Completed Courses

I love a [MOOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course). Below is a list of the courses I've completed, ordered with the most recent at the top. Where available, I've linked to certificates of completion. Who doesn't love a PDF certificate with their name on it? I know I do üòâ
