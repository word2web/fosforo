I used to kid myself that procrastination was not one of my vices. And then I tried to launch this website. Somehow it always seemed to be on the backburner.

Perhaps it is my natural reticence to stand in the limelight. But a wee personal website is hardly the limelight so I will put my hesitation down to something more geeky: my quest for the perfect [static site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators/). Oh, I've tried a few.

What I've learned is: *there is no such thing as a perfect static site generator.* They all have their weaknesses and the learning curve on some is just to steep.

At the moment, I've settled for [Lume](https://lume.land/), a lovely Deno based static site generator that works without a fuss and has a versatile admin panel that allows me to write and edit content in a GUI. This was the deal breaker for me and I don't know why more static site generators don't play around with this idea. We don't all love writing in markdown. Lume is the [Galician]([Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician_language)) word for fire by the way.

With Lume, there really was no excuse for further delay. I am starting some courses that will require an online porfolio so I need this website to show them off as they come online. So in the spirit of Agile delivery, here it is then, my *minimum viable website*.

In terms of content stategy there are currently three underlying principles:

1. Blog posts will be short and sparing. We are drowning in digital content and I don't want to bring any unloved posts into the world
2. There will be no images unless absolutely relevant.
3. I will not run my text through AI or get it to write for me. I don't want to lose the skill of thinking for myself even if the end product is rougher that might otherwise be possible.

It's going to be a very simple affair but if you've read this far it's done its job. 

Thanks for reading ❤️.
